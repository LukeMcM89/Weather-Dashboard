This coursework proved to be challenging and took me quite a long time. I scrapped the original HTML structure I had, only to revert back to what I originally had as it supported what I needed to achieve better than my reworked HTML. I am disappointed that I cannot get any icons to load, but I'm fairly certain that it has something to do with my file structure and how the downloaded files fit in respectively. 

I utitlized https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/ for the icon pallete.


Moving forward I'd like to get that last bit working, as all other parameters for the coursework are fullfilled. 

Thank you for your time!
