# Weather-Dashboard
A weather dashboard that displays weather at a glance.

When a user inputs a city name, the UV index changes with a corresponding color and a 5 day forecast is shown.

I utitlized https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/ for the icon pallete.

This coursework proved to be challenging and took me quite a long time. I scrapped the original HTML structure I had, only to revert back to what I originally had as it supported what I needed to achieve better than my reworked HTML. I am disappointed that I cannot get any icons to load, but I'm fairly certain that it has something to do with my file structure and how the downloaded files fit in respectively. 

(Icons are working. It was a file structure issue)

Thank you for your time!
